# Predicting-Pre-Approved-Personal-Loans-Python
Key Objectives

Loan Eligibility Prediction (Classification Model)

Identify customers who are likely to take a pre-approved personal loan based on financial and credit history.

Loan Amount Estimation (Regression Model)

Predict the optimal loan amount a customer should be offered based on income and financial stability.

Data Used

The dataset contains 1,000 customers, with features like:

✅ Age
✅ Credit Score (300–850)
✅ Income (Annual salary)
✅ Existing Loans (Number of ongoing loans)
✅ Monthly Expenses
✅ Savings Balance
✅ Pre-Approved Loan (Target - Yes/No)
✅ Loan Amount Offered (Target - Estimated amount)

Process & Methodology

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Generated a synthetic dataset with realistic financial details.

Normalized the features for better model performance.

2️⃣ Train-Test Split

Divided the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

3️⃣ Model Development

Random Forest Classifier → Predicts loan eligibility.

Linear Regression → Estimates the ideal loan amount.

4️⃣ Evaluation & Validation

Accuracy Score for loan eligibility prediction.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for loan amount estimation.

5️⃣ Prediction for New Customers

Given a customer’s details, the model predicts:

✅ Will they take a loan? (Yes/No)

✅ How much loan should be offered?

Business Impact

✅ Increased Loan Conversions → Targets the right customers.

✅ Personalized Loan Offers → Enhances customer experience.

✅ Risk Mitigation → Avoids offering loans to risky customers.

✅ Automation & Efficiency → Speeds up loan approval processes.

This project demonstrates how AI-driven decision-making can optimize financial services, making loan approvals more data-driven and customer-centric.
